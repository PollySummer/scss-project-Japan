          Japan, not only a mega-busy city that thrives on electronics and
          efficiency, actually has an almost sacred appreciation of nature.
          One must travel outside of Tokyo to truly experience the ‘old Japan’
          and more importantly feel these aspects of Japanese culture.

        Japan, island country lying off the east coast of Asia. It consists of
        a great string of islands in a northeast-southwest arc that stretches
        for approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km) through the western North
        Pacific Ocean. Nearly the entire land area is taken up by the
        country’s four main islands; from north to south these are Hokkaido
        (Hokkaidō), Honshu (Honshū), Shikoku, and Kyushu (Kyūshū). Honshu is
        the largest of the four, followed in size by Hokkaido, Kyushu, and
        Shikoku. In addition, there are numerous smaller islands, the major
        groups of which are the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands (including the island
        of Okinawa) to the south and west of Kyushu and the Izu, Bonin
        (Ogasawara), and Volcano (Kazan) islands to the south and east of
        central Honshu. The national capital, Tokyo (Tōkyō), in east-central
        Honshu, is one of the world’s most populous cities.

        <p class="geo">
          Japan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.t stretches over 3000 km
          northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.The country's five main islands, from north to
          south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain
          to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are
          often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2. Japan has the
          sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km. Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the
          eighth-largest exclusive economic zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 .
          <br> The Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural. The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain
          is restricted for habitation. Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population
          densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country. Honshu has the highest population density at 450
          persons/km2  as of 2010, while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016. As of 2014,
          approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land . Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's
          largest freshwater lake.
          <br> Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along
          the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk
          Index. Japan has 111 active volcanoes. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times
          each century; the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great
          Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.

          Japan's total population in 2021 was 125.50 million. This ranked 11th in the world and made up 1.6 percent of
          the world's total. Japan's population density measured 338.2 persons per square kilometer in 2020, ranking
          12th among countries or areas with a population of 10 million or more.
          <br> From the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century, Japan's population remained steady at
          about 30 million. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, it began expanding in tandem with the drive to
          build a modern nation-state. In 1912, it reached 50 million, and in 1967, it surpassed the 100 million mark.
          However, Japan's population growth slowed afterward, with the rate of population change about 1 percent from
          the 1960s through the 1970s. Since the 1980s, it has declined sharply. Japan's total population was 126.15
          million according to the Population Census in 2020. The Population Census in 2015 marked the first decline in
          Japan's total population since the initiation of the Census in 1920. The decline continued in the Population
          Census in 2020, with a decrease of 948,646 people compared to the previous Census (2015). In 2021, it was
          125.50 million, down by 0.64 million from the year before.

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p class="about-arch">
          An indigenous religious sensibility that long preceded Buddhism perceived that a spiritual realm was manifest
          in nature. Rock outcroppings, waterfalls, and gnarled old trees were viewed as the abodes of spirits and were
          understood as their personification. This belief system endowed much of nature with numinous qualities. It
          nurtured, in turn, a sense of proximity to and intimacy with the world of spirit as well as a trust in
          nature’s general benevolence. The cycle of the seasons was deeply instructive and revealed, for example, that
          immutability and transcendent perfection were not natural norms. Everything was understood as subject to a
          cycle of birth, fruition, death, and decay. Imported Buddhist notions of transience were thus merged with the
          indigenous tendency to seek instruction from nature. <br>
          Attentive proximity to nature developed and reinforced an aesthetic that generally avoided artifice. In the
          production of works of art, the natural qualities of constitutive materials were given special prominence and
          understood as integral to whatever total meaning a work professed. When, for example, Japanese Buddhist
          sculpture of the 9th century moved from the stucco or bronze Tang models and turned for a time to natural,
          unpolychromed woods, already ancient iconographic forms were melded with a preexisting and multilevel respect
          for wood. <br>
          Union with the natural was also an element of Japanese architecture. Architecture seemed to conform to nature.
          The symmetry of Chinese-style temple plans gave way to asymmetrical layouts that followed the specific
          contours of hilly and mountainous topography. The borders existing between structures and the natural world
          were deliberately obscure. Elements such as long verandas and multiple sliding panels offered constant vistas
          on nature—although the nature was often carefully arranged and fabricated rather than wild and real. <br>
          The perfectly formed work of art or architecture, unweathered and pristine, was ultimately considered distant,
          cold, and even grotesque. This sensibility was also apparent in tendencies of Japanese religious iconography.
          The ordered hierarchical sacred cosmology of the Buddhist world generally inherited from China bore the
          features of China’s earthly imperial court system. While some of those features were retained in Japanese
          adaptation, there was also a concurrent and irrepressible trend toward creating easily approachable deities.
          This usually meant the elevation of ancillary deities such as Jizō Bosatsu (Sanskrit: Kshitigarbha
          bodhisattva) or Kannon Bosatsu (Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva) to levels of increased cult devotion. The
          inherent compassion of supreme deities was expressed through these figures and their iconography. <br>

          <p>The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable
            films dating from 1917.

            The first generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi and Seitaro
            Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime. Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi
            (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made during
            World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, separating itself from its Western roots, and
            developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre. Typical shows from this period
            include Astro Boy, Lupin III and Mazinger Z. During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially
            Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii. <br>

            In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the rise in
            popularity of anime like Gundam, Macross, Dragon Ball, and genres such as real robot, space opera and
            cyberpunk. Space Battleship Yamato and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross also achieved worldwide success
            after being adapted respectively as Star Blazers and Robotech.

            The film Akira set records in 1988 for the production costs of an anime film and went on to become an
            international success. Later, in 2004, the same creators produced Steamboy, which took over as the most
            expensive anime film. Spirited Away shared the first prize at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival and won the 2003
            Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while Innocence: Ghost in the Shell was featured at the 2004 Cannes
            Film Festival. <br>

        <h2>Tea Ceremony</h2>
        <p>
          The Japanese tea ceremony (茶道, sadō or chadō, lit. "the way of tea" or 茶の湯, chanoyu) is a Japanese tradition
          steeped in history. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and drinking green tea typically in a traditional
          tearoom with tatami floor. Beyond just serving and receiving tea, one of the main purposes of the tea ceremony
          is for the guests to enjoy the hospitality of the host in an atmosphere distinct from the fast pace of
          everyday life. <br>

          Today, the tea ceremony is practiced as a hobby, and there are places where tourists can experience it, as
          well. Tea ceremonies of varying degrees of formality and authenticity are offered by many organizations across
          Japan, including at some traditional gardens, culture centers and hotels. Kyoto and Uji are among the best
          destinations in the country to enjoy Japan's tea culture. <br>

        <p>
          Tea was introduced to Japan in the 8th century from China and was drunk as a medicinal beverage mainly amongst
          priests and the upper class. It was not until the Muromachi Period (1333-1573) that the beverage gained
          popularity among people of all social classes. Among the affluent members of society, tea drinking parties
          became popular in which participants would show off their exquisite tea bowls and display their knowledge
          about tea. <br>

          Around the same time, a more refined version of tea parties developed with Zen-inspired simplicity and a
          greater emphasis on spirituality. It is from these gatherings that the tea ceremony has its origins. The
          father of the modern way of tea was Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591) who advocated an austere, rustic simplicity. Most
          of today's schools of tea ceremony, including Omotesenke and Urasenke, developed from his teachings. <br>
