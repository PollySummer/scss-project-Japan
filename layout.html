            Japan, not only a mega-busy city that thrives on electronics and
            efficiency, actually has an almost sacred appreciation of nature.
            One must travel outside of Tokyo to truly experience the ‘old Japan’
            and more importantly feel these aspects of Japanese culture.

          Japan, island country lying off the east coast of Asia. It consists of
          a great string of islands in a northeast-southwest arc that stretches
          for approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km) through the western North
          Pacific Ocean. Nearly the entire land area is taken up by the
          country’s four main islands; from north to south these are Hokkaido
          (Hokkaidō), Honshu (Honshū), Shikoku, and Kyushu (Kyūshū). Honshu is
          the largest of the four, followed in size by Hokkaido, Kyushu, and
          Shikoku. In addition, there are numerous smaller islands, the major
          groups of which are the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands (including the island
          of Okinawa) to the south and west of Kyushu and the Izu, Bonin
          (Ogasawara), and Volcano (Kazan) islands to the south and east of
          central Honshu. The national capital, Tokyo (Tōkyō), in east-central
          Honshu, is one of the world’s most populous cities.

      <h2>Geography</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="geo">
      Japan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.t stretches over 3000 km northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2. Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km. Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth-largest exclusive economic zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 .
<br> The Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural. The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation. Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country. Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2  as of 2010, while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016. As of 2014, approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land . Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.
<br> Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index. Japan has 111 active volcanoes. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century; the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.

      Japan's total population in 2021 was 125.50 million. This ranked 11th in the world and made up 1.6 percent of the world's total. Japan's population density measured 338.2 persons per square kilometer in 2020, ranking 12th among countries or areas with a population of 10 million or more.
     <br> From the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century, Japan's population remained steady at about 30 million. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, it began expanding in tandem with the drive to build a modern nation-state. In 1912, it reached 50 million, and in 1967, it surpassed the 100 million mark. However, Japan's population growth slowed afterward, with the rate of population change about 1 percent from the 1960s through the 1970s. Since the 1980s, it has declined sharply. Japan's total population was 126.15 million according to the Population Census in 2020. The Population Census in 2015 marked the first decline in Japan's total population since the initiation of the Census in 1920. The decline continued in the Population Census in 2020, with a decrease of 948,646 people compared to the previous Census (2015). In 2021, it was 125.50 million, down by 0.64 million from the year before.
